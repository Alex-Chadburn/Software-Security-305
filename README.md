# Software-Security-305
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that provides tailored financial planning services, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company partnered with Global Rain to modernize its operations and enhance the security of its public-facing web application. The primary requirement was to implement a secure data verification step using a cryptographic checksum, ensuring the integrity of client data during transmission. My task was to assess the existing codebase, identify vulnerabilities, and refactor the application to meet current software security standards.

One of the more challenging aspects of the project was configuring the self-signed certificate for HTTPS. The provided code was outdated and did not include Subject Alternative Names (SAN), which are now required for self-signed certificates to be recognized as valid and trustworthy by modern browsers. I had to research and update the certificate generation process to include SAN for localhost, ensuring that the secure communication channel would be properly verified. In addition to implementing the .p12 keystore and SHA-256 checksum verification, I conducted iterative testing, manual code reviews, and used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to confirm that the refactored application remained secure and functional without introducing new vulnerabilities. Secure coding is essential to protect sensitive data, maintain user trust, and prevent costly breaches. This project emphasized the importance of encryption, layered security, and adherence to industry best practices. For prospective employers, it demonstrates my ability to identify and mitigate security risks, apply modern encryption protocols, and deliver secure, production-ready software.
